In our Titanic Survival Prediction analysis, we discovered that only 36.4% of passengers survived. Survival rates varied by passenger class, gender, and age. Factors like family members and embarkation location also influence survival. We trained several classification models and all performed well (presented bellow) , likely because of the dataset's modest size.

In our movie analysis project, we fixed problems like missing data and errors in the dataset. We learned some cool things, like shorter movies getting better ratings and Drama being a popular genre. We also discovered that the Random Forest model worked the best for predicting ratings, with a high accuracy score of 0.88 on the training data and 0.84 on the test data

In our analysis of Iris flower classification, we distinguished between three distinct species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. These species were differentiated based on attributes such as petal length and width, as well as sepal length and width. We trained multiple classification models, all of which exhibited strong performance, which can be attributed to the relatively small size of the dataset.

## Task 4 : Car sales prediction 🚘⛽🛣️

## Task 5 : Credit card fraud detection 💳🏦💲

In this task, we built a smart system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By using various classification algorithms, we found that the Random Forest algorithm provided the best accuracy. With some smart features, we created a powerful model that effectively detected fraudulent transactions while minimizing errors. We also handled the data imbalance and preprocessed the data effectively. However, we can further improve the model by fine-tuning some settings, trying out different approaches, and incorporating more data about fraudulent transactions.
