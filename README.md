In our Titanic Survival Prediction analysis, we discovered that only 36.4% of passengers survived. Survival rates varied by passenger class, gender, and age. Factors like family members and embarkation location also influence survival. We trained several classification models and all performed well (presented bellow) , likely because of the dataset's modest size.

In our movie analysis project, we fixed problems like missing data and errors in the dataset. We learned some cool things, like shorter movies getting better ratings and Drama being a popular genre. We also discovered that the Random Forest model worked the best for predicting ratings, with a high accuracy score of 0.88 on the training data and 0.84 on the test data
