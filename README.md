In our Titanic Survival Prediction analysis, we discovered that only 36.4% of passengers survived. Survival rates varied by passenger class, gender, and age. Factors like family members and embarkation location also influence survival. We trained several classification models and all performed well (presented bellow) , likely because of the dataset's modest size.
